Overall Plot:
Player has to escape an unknown environment after being trapped by an unknown deity.

Ideas:
1. Burnable objects to expose new areas/paths of escape
2. Activatables throughout levels
3. Player should understand the reason they are emitting light, should come across a torch early in game (unlit and lit) to teach torch lighting mechanic

Pulse Ideas:
1. A way for the player to illuminate surroundings
2. Potentially a way for the player to fend off enemies, enemy mechanics not determined yet
3. Pulse illumination should not pass through walls
4. Pulse is unlimited, however incentivise using the ability as few times as possible
5. Pulse will leave a fire on the map where it is used by the player
6. Hitbox that can interact with objects, allowing the player to interact with the environment


Puzzle Ideas:
1. Player has to put their Fire Pulse in a certain location to see an object providing information. The player can then go to another place on the map (one where the camera can still see the object) to activate
   a trigger. This trigger would cause the object near the player's pulse to change in some way, giving the player information to open a door.
2. Good intro, find a place to stand to activate your ability. Wooden planks could be burned away from ability, but the area with the plank is nestled away, so player has to find it in order to burn it and progress.
   Teach the player the benefit of exploration.
3. Use ability in certain spot.
4. Memory?
5. Pressure plate idea.
